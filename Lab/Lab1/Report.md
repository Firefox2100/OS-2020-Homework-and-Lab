## Practice 1

### 1

The shell expression ``$home`` or ``~`` refers to the home directory of current user. To change to home directory, simply use ``cd ~`` or ``cd $home``.

### 2

If all requested directory exists, then ``cd /usr/lib/`` should bring me to ``/usr/lib``, ``cd ./bin/`` should bring me to ``/usr/lib/bin``, ``cd ..`` should return to ``/usr/lib``. The command ``pwd`` should print the absolute directory I'm on, which is ``/usr/lib``. In shell command, ``.`` means on current directory, ``..`` means one level of directory upper than current.

### 3

This is a test if cat.

### 4

The result is:

./testcat.txt

The meaning of ``> list.lst`` is to redirect the output of find command to a file called "list.lst".
